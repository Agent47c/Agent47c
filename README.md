### 🏠 **House Price Prediction Model**
Built a **House Price Prediction Model** during my **Certura Internship**. The model predicts house prices based on key features like the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and nearby schools.  
I trained three models: **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, and **Linear Regression**, ultimately choosing **Linear Regression** for its simplicity and performance.

- **Technologies**: Python, Machine Learning, Regression Models, Streamlit.
- **Key Features**:
  - Predicts house prices based on user inputs.
  - Models compared include **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, and **Linear Regression**.
  - **Streamlit frontend** for real-time price predictions.

## 🎓 **Arch Technologies Internship**

During my **Arch Technologies Internship**, I had the opportunity to work on a **Brain Tumor Detection Model**. The task involved using **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** for object detection on **MRI images** to identify possible tumor regions. I also incorporated **SAM (Segment Anything Model)** for more refined segmentation of the tumor regions.  
The result was an intelligent model for detecting brain tumors from medical images, which could be used in the healthcare industry.

- **Technologies**: Python, YOLO, SAM, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Medical Imaging.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Object detection** with **YOLO** on MRI scans.
  - **Segmentation** of tumor regions with **SAM**.
  - **Real-time prediction** using **Streamlit** frontend.
